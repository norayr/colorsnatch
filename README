file supplied with the game. Just in case, they always have
a spare copy of the GPL at http://gnu.org/

----Installation-----------------
Just copy the binary files (you'll have to compile them first,
of course, if you only have the source) to the directory
you want them to sit. You could also make a link in your /bin 
directory or in your Gnome/KDE/whatever menus.

----Playing----------------------
1) The menu:
Game -> Single Player Game: Start a game vs the AI.
Game -> Two Player Game: Start a game vs a human.
Game -> End Game: End the current game.
Game -> Quit: Quit.

Options -> Diversity: Choose how small the same
                      coloured groups of tiles will be.
Options -> Time Limit: That's it, the time limit.

Theme: choose your theme for the tiles.

Language: choose the language for the interface.

Help -> About: The about box. Totally useless, but tells
               you about the GPL stuff, so, I think, making
	       that was worth the time.

2) Gameplay:
Player 1 starts at the lower left corner, player 2 in the upper
right. Each turn players choose one color to add to their territory.
Then, all adjacent tiles of that color are included. The first player
to capture 50% of the field wins. Press Up/Down to pick a color, and
Spacebar/Return to make the move before time runs out.
Since version 1.0.3 you can also click the desired color with the mouse.

----Credit for the game concept and the programming tools-------

ColorSnatch is inspired by a wonderful game I used to play 
on my 80286 machine. The game, called 'Filler', was written 
in 1990 by Dmitri Pashkov, Michael Katunsky and Alexander 
Corabelnikov.

In that time programming was still an art; now it is craft
at best. The games had original ideas, they had performance,
they had style, they were FUN. Sigh. 
The 'Filler' game was one of the first PC games I ever 
played, so I made this clone/remake/whatever chiefly 
because of nostalgia.

I also wanted to test the Lazarus library/IDE, which I
discovered only recently. The game took only a couple
of days of actual programming, so I suppose Lazarus
is a mighty RAD tool already and only going to improve.

ColorSnatch was written from scratch in Pascal language using
the Lazarus IDE. Lazarus is a Delphi-compatible free and open 
source visual components library and IDE for various platforms.
For example, ColorSnatch was written and compiled under 
Linux OS (specifically, ASPLinux9, with kernel 2.4.20).

The images and icons for the game were made with The GIMP,
first with 1.2 version and then with 2.0 as soon as it was
available.
