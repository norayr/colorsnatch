Sorry, no config script, no makefile, no nothing.

You'll need a fresh Free Pascal Compiler and Lazarus libraries to build
the program. After you have the Lazarus IDE it shouldn't be difficult
to compile and install the program. If you want to go that way, you
best try would be http://lazarus.freepascal.org/

The project file (colorsnatch.lpi) is supplied along with the project.
If you experience problems with it, please use Project -> New Project from 
file (colorsnatch.lpr), this should help.

If you only intend to use this program, not modify it, your best option
is to download the binary tarball for your system from wherever you
downloaded the source.

To install the binaries simply copy the contents of the tarball into the 
directory of your choosing and optionally create links to it in your /usr/bin
directory, in your Gnome/KDE menus or wherever you like.
